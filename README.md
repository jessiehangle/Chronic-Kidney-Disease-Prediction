## Tools: 
R, Data Manipulating (Package MICE), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Data Visualization (Excel, ggplot2)

## Objective: 
In this study, we are to detect at-risk patients from a previous obtained clinical dataset, to define a series of factors that could indicate the presence of CKD, and to develop our credible and easy-to-use screening tool to measure an overall risk for random individual. The dataset contains various information-including demographic (age, gender, and race group) as well as physical record (whether an individual has a certain kind of disease in the past or not) of 8,819 individuals.
